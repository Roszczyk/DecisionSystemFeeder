# Project Gruchberta

A pigeon laid eggs on my balcony. This gave me an idea to create a testbed before the Feeder. There will be RGB camera, YOLO and the whole systems test conducted to keep an eye on the pigeons and document the incubation, hatching and the first days of baby pigeons. 

I named the pigeon ```Gruchberta```, which is also the name of the whole side-project.
